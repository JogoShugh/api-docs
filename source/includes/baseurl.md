# Base URL

Find your VersionOne url may look like this https://www7.v1host.com/VersionOne.

In this case `www7.v1host.com` is your `V1Host` and `VersionOne` is your `V1Instance`.
These will be used to build your base url that all requests to the API rely on.

<aside class="notice">
For the remainder of this guide when you see <code>V1Host</code> and <code>V1Instance</code> replace these values with your VersionOne instance's url.

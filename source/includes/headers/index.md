# HTTP Headers

For this guide we will only show the VersionOne server accepting and responding with JSON.

The `Content-Type` header tells the server what media type we are sending it in the request body.
The `Accept` header tells the server what media type to respond to the request with.

Ensure that every request contains the following HTTP headers

`Content-Type: applicaiton/json`  

`Accept: application/json`
